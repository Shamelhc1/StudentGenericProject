# ðŸ“š Student Query System

A modular Java application that models student data and provides a flexible querying mechanism using generic programming and object-oriented principles. Designed as a learning project to demonstrate inheritance, polymorphism, custom comparators, and reusable utility structures in Java.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project simulates a system for managing and querying student records. It defines a base Studen class, an extended LpaStudent class, and utilizes a generic QueryList utility to filter and manipulate data collections.

This project serves both as a **portfolio piece** and an **educational resource** for intermediate Java developers aiming to practice real-world software design patterns.
